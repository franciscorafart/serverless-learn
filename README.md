# Serverless Framework AWS NodeJS Example

This template demonstrates how to deploy a NodeJS function running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework. The deployed function does not include any event definitions as well as any kind of persistence (database). For more advanced configurations check out the [examples repo](https://github.com/serverless/examples/) which includes integrations with SQS, DynamoDB or examples of functions that are triggered in `cron`-like manner. For details about configuration of specific `events`, please refer to our [documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/).

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (112s)

functions:
  function1: aws-node-project-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

#### Deploy individual function
To avoid re-building the whole cloud formation stack just run theploy in an individual function:

`sls deploy function -f my-function`

### Logs
Log all deployed functions locally (faster than Cloud Watch and free)
`sls dev --verbose`

#### Log specific function
`sls dev -f my-function`

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke --function function1
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": {}\n}"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": \"\"\n}"
}
```

#### Passing a body to a local call
`serverless invoke local -f functionName --data '{"a":"bar"}'`
